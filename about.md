I'm a professional engineering, quantitative, and research consultant based out
of lovely Auckland, New Zealand.

I specialize in:

*  statically-typed functional programming
*  compilers and language engineering
*  probabilistic programming
*  Bayesian statistics/machine learning
*  data munging and numerical algorithms
*  asynchronous/remote work
*  technical writing and communication

I also like to keep my toes dipped in academia and am interested in fields
surrounding computation and probability.  I enjoy research in:

*  theoretical computer science
*  probability theory
*  quantum information
*  cryptography
*  microeconomics, algorithmic game theory, and mechanism design
*  distributed systems

I try to at least attend [NIPS](https://nips.cc) and
[ICFP](http://http://icfpconference.org/) annually, so feel free to say hello.

I've been involved in a number of senior- and principal-level engineering &
analytics positions and am always happy to hear from people doing interesting
things.  Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:jared@jtobin.ca) if you might be
keen on doing something together.  I'm particularly delighted to hear from
people who are working on open-source projects or open access research.
