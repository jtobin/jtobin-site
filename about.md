I'm a professional engineering, quantitative, and research consultant based out
of lovely Auckland, New Zealand.

I specialize in:

*  statically-typed functional programming
*  compilers and language engineering
*  probabilistic programming
*  Bayesian statistics/machine learning
*  data munging and numerical algorithms
*  asynchronous/remote work

I like to keep my toes dipped in academia and am interested in other fields
surrounding computation and probability as well.  I enjoy following research
in:

*  theoretical computer science
*  probability theory
*  quantum information
*  microeconomics, algorithmic game theory, and mechanism design
*  distributed systems

I try to at least attend [NIPS](https://nips.cc) and
[ICFP](http://http://icfpconference.org/) annually, so feel free to say hello
if you see me there.

I've been involved in a number of senior- and principal-level engineering,
research, and analytics positions and am always happy to hear from people doing
interesting things.  Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:jared@jtobin.ca) if you
might be keen on doing something together.  I'm particularly delighted to hear
from people who are working on open-source projects or open access research.
