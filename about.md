I'm a professional quantitative, engineering, and research consultant based out
of Auckland, New Zealand.

I specialize in:

*  Bayesian statistics / probabilistic machine learning
*  statically-typed functional programming
*  data science and numerical algorithms
*  compilers and language engineering
*  asynchronous/remote work

I like to keep my toes dipped in academia and am interested in other fields
surrounding computation and probability as well.  I enjoy following research
in:

*  algorithmic game theory
*  Bayesian nonparametrics
*  probabilistic programming
*  theoretical computer science

I try to attend some subset of [NIPS](https://nips.cc),
[ICFP](http://icfpconference.org/), and
[EC](http://www.sigecom.org/ec16/index.html) annually, so say hello if you see
me and we can go grab a coffee.

I've been involved in a number of senior- and principal-level engineering,
research, and data science positions and am always happy to hear from people
doing interesting things.  Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:jared@jtobin.ca)
if you might be keen on doing something together.
